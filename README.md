# Software Analytics and Machine Learning for Software Engineering (IN4334)

Software repositories archive valuable software engineering data, such as source code, execution traces, historical code changes, mailing lists, and bug reports. This data contains a wealth of information about a project’s status and history. Doing data science on software repositories, researchers can gain empirically based understanding of software development practices, and practitioners can better manage, maintain, and evolve complex software projects.

The goal of this seminar course is to give students an in-depth perspective of software analytics and machine learning for software engineering methods.
