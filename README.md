# Software Analytics and Machine Learning for Software Engineering (IN4334)

Software repositories archive valuable software engineering data, such as source code, execution traces, historical code changes, mailing lists, and bug reports. This data contains a wealth of information about a project’s status and history. Doing data science on software repositories, researchers can gain empirically based understanding of software development practices, and practitioners can better manage, maintain, and evolve complex software projects.

The goal of this seminar course is to give students an in-depth perspective of software analytics and machine learning for software engineering methods.

## Structure

In a nutshell: 

* The course is composed of lectures, guest lectures, and paper discussions. 
* Each student is responsible for one or two papers, depending on the number of students that enrol in the course. The student presents the paper to the colleagues and answer their questions. In the end of the course, the student also delivers a clear summary of the paper. Read more about how to select the paper, how to prepare the presentation, and how to write the summary later in this page.
* Each student proposes some new research in the topics of software analytics or machine learning. To that aim, the student writes a registered report paper. See the [instructions](https://2021.msrconf.org/track/msr-2021-registered-reports?#Author-s-Guide-) the MSR conference gives to its authors.
* In the end of the course, students present their research ideas.

## Schedule

### September 2nd: What's software analytics? What's machine learning for software engineering?

In this lecture, I will discuss what this course is all about. I will also explain the overall procedure, assessment, and projects.

As a preparation for this lecture, please read the following paper: _A. E. Hassan and T. Xie, “Software intelligence: The future of mining software engineering data,” in Proceedings of the fse/sdp workshop on future of software engineering research, 2010, pp. 161–166._

### September 7th: Machine Learning for Software Engineering

In this lecture, I will give you an introduction to the machine learning for software engineering topic.

As a preparation for this lecture, please read the following paper: _Pradel, M., & Chandra, S. (2020). Neural software analysis. arXiv preprint arXiv:2011.07986._

### September 9th: Diomidis Spinellis on software analytics

Diomidis Spinellis, Professor of Software Engineering in the Department of Management Science and Technology of the Athens University of Economics and Business, Professor of Software Analytics in the Department of Software Technology of the Delft University of Technology, and director of the Business Analytics Laboratory (BALab).

Diomidis is one of the most influential researchers in the field of empirical software engineering and software analytics. He will talk about his views on the topic.

_No preparation needed_

### September 14th: Paper discussions
