# Software Analytics and Machine Learning for Software Engineering (IN4334)

Software repositories archive valuable software engineering data, such as source code, execution traces, historical code changes, mailing lists, and bug reports. This data contains a wealth of information about a project’s status and history. Doing data science on software repositories, researchers can gain empirically based understanding of software development practices, and practitioners can better manage, maintain, and evolve complex software projects.

The goal of this seminar course is to give students an in-depth perspective of software analytics and machine learning for software engineering methods.

## Structure

In a nutshell: 

* The course is composed of lectures, guest lectures, and paper discussions. 
* Each team of students (2 people) is responsible for one paper. The team presents the paper to the colleagues and answer their questions. In the end of the course, the team also delivers a clear summary of the paper. Read more about how to select the paper, how to prepare the presentation, and how to write the summary later in this page.
* Each team proposes some new research in the topics of software analytics or machine learning and writes a short paper containing the plan. 
* In the end of the course, team present their research ideas.

### October 29th: Presentation day and project deadline

Each team will present their research project:

* 10-15 minutes presentation
* 10 minutes of questions

If allowed, this may happen on-campus.

## Deliverables

Teams have two deliverables throughout the course:

* A summary of a software analytics or machine learning for software engineering paper
* The research project

### Paper summary

Each team is responsible for one paper summary. This task is composed of:

* One 10+5 (or 10+10 depending on the number of papers in that session) minutes presentation summarizing the paper to the other students. This presentation will be given in one of the slots in our schedule. The presentation should be composed of:
  * Motivation of work: what problem does it solve? why is this an important problem?
  * Approach: how does the paper do it? 
  * Results: what are the findings of the paper?
  * Implications: how do the findings change the way we build software?
* A summary of the paper in a blog post format. 
  * See [summary format](summary-format.md) for more details on how this should be written
  * We partnered up with the [Never Work in Theory](https://neverworkintheory.org/) blog is an initiative of Greg Wilson. The blog, as described in its own page, contains "short summaries of recent results in empirical software engineering research". At the end of the course, your article might be published there (_optional_)! Do your best!

You are free to select a paper. Go for the topic that you are most interested! Some interesting lists of papers:

* [Never Work in Theory's TODO list](https://neverworkintheory.org/todo/). This list mostly contains papers on software analytics and empirical software engineering.
* Any of the Machine Learning papers we discussed in [last year's edition of this seminar](https://gousios.org/courses/ml4se/), which was way more focused on ML.

Note that two teams cannot work on the same paper. The first team that picks the paper has the priority.

The deadline of the presentation is the day of your presentation. I will assign teams to slots randomly. The deadline of the summary is the last day of the course. Feel free to ask for feedback before the deadline.

Select your paper and pick your summary presentation day in our Google Spreadsheets. First come first served! See the link in our Mattermost.

### Research project

You will be reading and watching many paper presentations. It is time for you to try out and propose some interesting software analytics or machine learning for software engineering research. 

You can go for:

* A completely new research idea that has nothing to do with the papers we discussed. Maybe you have some experience in SE and wants to better understand some phenomenon.
* An extension of a paper we discussed. Maybe you saw a paper and thought: "hmm, I'd research it differently; I'd go for a controlled experiment rather than a mining study". Feel free to propose extensions of papers.

You should write a registered report that explains your research idea. See the [instructions](https://2021.msrconf.org/track/msr-2021-registered-reports?#Author-s-Guide-) the MSR conference gives to its authors. This should be written in Markdown. Note the examples at the bottom of the page there. Also see an [example](research-project-format.md) of the Markdown file you should deliver.

Note that you are only going to write about the idea and its methodology; you are not going to execute the research itself here. Nevertheless, if you really appreciated your proposal and wants to do it, you are free to use this paper as a plan for your MSc thesis research!

You should also prepare a presentation of your research proposal, which you will give in the last day of the course.

The deadline of the research project is the day of the final presentation. Feel free to ask for feedback before that!

## Assessment

* 50% paper summary
* 50% research report

We do not offer resits.
